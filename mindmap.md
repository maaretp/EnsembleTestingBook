# Ensemble Testing

## Value of Ensemble Testing

## Discovery and Delivery Work

## Structures

### Roles

#### Facilitator

#### Recorder

## Activities

### Enumerate test cases early on

### Explore in sessions

## Variations on Setup

### Co-located Ensemble

### Remote Ensemble

### Ensemble with an Audience

### Foundational Teaching Ensemble

### Popcorn Ensemble

### Testing in Ensemble Programming


## Compare and Contrast

### Group Testing

### Testing Dojo

### Bug Bash

### Pair Testing


## Impediments to adoption

### Ego

### Management Support

### Fear in Lack of Safety

### Concern on slowing the ensemble down


## Testers tend to

### Ask great questions

### Keep users at focus

### Include variation in use

### Stay on story scope

willingness to try
spike work
support case work
reviewing test results
new code for everyone
well scoped, clear acceptance criteria
working on a legacy area
investigative work
research
ensembling makes pairing more common, healthier pairs
discrepancy in skill level related to title
having different skillsets
frequent rotations
switch on time / task
answers to all questions in the room, zero question queue time
huddling, not rotating the driver navigator roles
charter-based time-boxed sessions

## key differences in solo testing vs. ensemble testing
- bias / different perspectives / thinking laterally / more ideas
- visual cues, people building on each other's observations
- observing different things
- making connections for constraints
- different skillsets, not come teach me I slow you down
- set bar really low
- empathy as an output
- title and skill difference - protect the emotional space
- set the stage -- walk just into experience
- two ways of starting
- comfort zone when stressed

- getting testability features by ensembling on something where testability sucks
- getting fixes when they don't think they're needed

Mob testing sessions typically focus on testing a part of the application and can include exploratory testing and test automation. The technique works well when testing teams have specific testing-oriented tasks. Although mob programming teams typically spend most, if not all, of their working week with the mob, Pyhäjärvi advises that mob testing should be used primarily for training and as relatively short "breakout" sessions from mob programming. If testers are spending most of their working week doing mob testing, then the teams should re-evaluate the relationship between testers and developers.

A mob testing session is a great way to help introverted team members learn when and how to speak up and contribute and also teaches extroverted testers when to step back and allow other people’s voices to be heard. While becoming more effective testers and knowing their product better, testers learn the skills that they need when they join in mob programming sessions with developers. Mob testing is as much about learning as it is about testing.
