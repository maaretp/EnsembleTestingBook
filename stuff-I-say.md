# Things I say

We found stuff in 1.5 hrs that I could have spent weeks missing alone.

When Ensemble Testing with automation something, I asked how long until we’re done. People thought hours. 20 minutes later we had over hundred cases, branches covered and finished with a discussion of what other perspectives there are.

"It's not ensembling if you don't tell me exactly what buttons to click" was a misunderstanding of intent vs. details in navigation we sorted out today.

Four minutes feels too short to complete what you’re doing when ensemble testing, that’s the point! Next people continue in the roles from where the idea left off.

Yesterday the ensemble testing group taught me to look at values passing through in three categories: those that never change, those passing through key logic and others. Love the heuristic for making choices where to focus testing on an API.

The moment when you start ensemble testing something you've never seen before or know nothing about - and find a bug that blocks use of feature.

Can’t try ensemble testing at work? Try what I did, set up a meetup group to mob with you on after hours. Lovely community.

Read a couple of articles on mob testing from your epic list of articles, made an intro in 30 minutes and we will try it in 5 min". The news I love to hear.

Tests strategy is the ideas that guide test design. I have plenty of ideas I reuse, and now I’m wondering on good ways of comparing implicit strategy elements especially when ensemble testing.

In ensemble testing, two outcomes for participants are valued: learning and contributing. For mobbing to make sense, we need to see learning, impacting future rather than today, in the core.

It’s not about productivity today but learning (and fun!) today to be productive tomorrow.

==> Do a retro in middle to get the retro results to improve the ensemble testing session you’re in. Short loop to learning works.

It still surprises me how a group on one computer can find things I did not by myself over longer time period.

Advice? Try it yourself, learn from it, revise and iterate.

Many many years before #EnsembleTesting was a thing, code kata inspired testing kata sessions reached Helsinki, Finland. While it was all brilliant minds, in same space, on same time, it watching a traditional pair + rotate. Strong-style navigation changes it.

2 people and 1-2 keyboards, shared activity: #PairTesting.
3+ people and 1-3+ keyboards, shared activity: #EnsembleTesting.
Temporary pairs and groups: #Swarming.
All of these: #SocialSoftwareTesting.
I frequently ensemble on tests where one keyboard isn't the constraint.

When I teach programming to beginners, I've come to talk about the roles in very simple terms: Hands type, Brains decide, Voices either help or confuse the hell out of the Brains. One entity while many people.

How do you acquire all these skills you need with increasing pace while still doing the work you're expected to do. #PairTesting #EnsembleTesting and the fact that 1.01^365 = 37.8. Learn to learn the 1% impact.

When #EnsembleTesting with me makes a manual tester more senior than me change their mind about learning programming so that they immediately start practicing after day 1 of 2 day training - priceless. Thankful for making one more dent in the world.

In #EnsembleTesting there’s tasks we all know how to do and learn about the differences in how we do it. Some tasks only one knows how to do, and we learn that. There’s tasks none knows how to do but together we can figure them out.

Loving the ex tempore #EnsembleTesting we did today on a teams channel. One person passing by joined, all four of us could list things we know know how to do but didn't know before and wouldn't have known to ask for.

Feedback from a training I did:
"Good training. Confusingly effective participation from participants. :D"
I read this as "I have not paired or ensembled online before". #EnsembleTesting is awesome in training.

I enjoy remote #EnsembleTesting more than sitting in the meeting room together. I have my own space, don't have to sit uncomfortably close to anyone, I can screen without squinting and we have to make rules to not try and shout on top of each other. What's not to like?

This adaptation of #EnsembleTesting we use on teaching of our Python for testing -course is interesting to me. We rotate drivers on their own computers and code along. A lot of navigating is from teachers.

I like for the person learning to drive while the person teaching navigates. Sometimes that can switch back and forth. Even when I was learning I would navigate sometimes (or just type ahead) for occasional things I knew well.

I also assume strong-style navigation and this switch the learner off keyboard as soon as they can hold idea of what to do next. While at keyboard they control pace of instruction intake. Switching teacher to drive happens less in ensemble as there is always another student.

Interesting conversations on how #EnsembleProgramming groups avoid discovery work leaving it to learning hours, whereas me moving a lot into #EnsembleTesting, group discovery is my core practice.

You combine two ideas and give it a new name, and you have invented something new. I did that with exploratory testing + ensemble programming and spent significant time in sharing on details of #EnsembleTesting, first.

#EnsembleProgramming is also two ideas combined: Coding dojos popularised by @emilybache and strong-style pair programming. Having been to coding dojos, it is essentially different in this combination.

#EnsembleProgramming and #ensembleTesting have become invaluable for me for growing the next generations of professionals as well as keeping the current generations continuously #learning

And when words fail, pairing with managers does not. When we can't explain what we do, we can show. In the last five years, I've invited numerous managers to #EnsembleTesting and they come out transformed, understanding a little more of why we need to make space for serendipity.

When implementing applications, tests are a great way in #EnsembleProgramming to share intent. When figuring out #EnsembleTesting, I spent a lot of time experimenting with how to share intent: from saying it, to charter, to test cases.

"Learning things you didn't know you need to know before seeing others do that."

The beauty of #EnsembleTesting is that all 'roles' cycle and there isn't the need for a facilitator. In this case the idea was pitched to a smaller group, we found results were positive.

I use systematic rotation of who is speaking (navigating) while we are learning, and give everyone a turn of speaking.

"Facilitator's role in #EnsembleTesting is to model how to navigate and help people get unstuck by asking the right questions and allowing the group to find answers."
